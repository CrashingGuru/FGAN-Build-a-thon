Therefore, there will be \\ndifferences between this prepublication and the published version.\\nFOREWORD \\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of \\ntelecommunications, information and communication technologies (ICTs). The ITU Telecommunication \\nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, \\noperating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations on them with a view to standardizing \\ntelecommunications on a worldwide basis. \\nThe World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years, \\nestablishes the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on \\nthese topics. \\nThe approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1. \\nIn some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T\\'s purview, the necessary standards are \\nprepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC. \\nNOTE \\nIn this publication, the expression \"Administration\" is used for conciseness to indicate both a \\ntelecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency. \\nCompliance with this publication is voluntary. However, the publication may contain certain mandatory \\nprovisions (to ensure, e.g., interoperability or applicability) and compliance with the publication is achieved \\nwhen all of these mandatory provisions are met. The words \"shall\" or some other obligatory language such as \\n\"must\" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The use of such words does not \\nsuggest that compliance with the publication is required of any party. \\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS \\nITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this publication may involve the \\nuse of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence, validity or \\napplicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others outside of \\nthe publication development process. \\nAs of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had [not] received notice of intellectual property, \\nprotected by patents/software copyrights, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. \\nHowever, implementers are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore \\nstrongly urged to consult the appropriate ITU-T databases available via the ITU-T website at \\nhttp://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/. \\nAll rights reserved. No part of this publication may be reproduced, by any means whatsoever, without the \\nprior written permission of ITU. \\n© ITU 2022 \\nSupplement 71 to ITU-T Y-3000 series Recommendations (formerly Y.Supp-\\nAN-Use Cases) \\nSummary \\n  Use cases for Autonomous Networks \\nThis Supplement discusses use cases for autonomous networks.  The use cases are divided into two \\ncategories, and possible requirements, interactions among actors and possible key components are also \\ndiscussed.   \\nVarious use cases are derived according to the key concepts behind autonomous networks of \\nexploratory evolution, real-time responsive experimentation and dynamic adaptation to enable \\nhandling of hitherto unseen changes in network scenarios or inputs to reduce the human effort involved \\nin managing the network. \\nKeywords \\nactor, artificial intelligence, autonomous networks, controller, component, knowledge, machine \\nlearning, requirement, use case \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n1\\nTable of Contents \\nPage \\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\nSCOPE

Thus, this possible \\nrequirement would not need to be enabled to provide complete benefits of the use case.  \\n• The keywords \"it is of added value\" indicate a possible requirement which would be \\noptional to be fulfilled (e.g., by an implementation), without implying any sense of \\nimportance regarding its fulfilment. Thus, this possible requirement would not need to be \\nenabled to provide complete benefits of the use case. \\n6\\nIntroduction \\nAs the demand and expectation of communication networks is growing, so are user subscriptions \\nand new service expectations. Network operators must find new ways to address these expectations \\nwhile at the same time controlling operational cost. Autonomous networks are those that possess the \\nability to monitor, operate, recover, heal, protect, optimize, and reconfigure themselves in order to \\nadapt to hitherto unseen changes in situations. These abilities are commonly known as the self-* \\nproperties. The impact of autonomy on the network touches many areas including planning, \\nsecurity, audit, inventory, optimisation, orchestration, and quality of experience. Hence, \\nautonomous networks form an important part of future networks not only to provide value-added \\nfeatures to the user, but also to reduce the management overheads for the network operator. The use \\ncases discussed in this document are based on considerations for enhancing end user experience, \\nmotivating autonomous behaviour in networks. \\nThe main concepts behind autonomous networks which are elaborated here are exploratory \\nevolution, real-time responsive experimentation and dynamic adaptation. To study and analyse use \\ncases along these concepts in networks, a basic building block called “controller” is introduced. \\nControllers are used in the use cases to further elaborate autonomous networks and the key concepts \\nrequired to enable them. \\nA controller is a system with workflows composed of modules, realizing or implementing specific \\nfunctionalities in the network. A controller’s modules can be designed independently of the network \\narchitecture, implemented, and integrated into the network after verification.  \\nA controller’s modules may themselves be workflows, open loops, or closed loops.  \\nExamples of controllers are closed loops [ITU-T Y.3115] implemented as software modules that \\naddress functionalities like monitoring, analysis and optimization. \\nDynamic changes in network scenarios and states may arise in the network as detected or identified \\nvia monitoring of the underlay network. Many of these situations may be hitherto unknown or \\nunseen in the network. The concept of exploratory evolution introduces the mechanisms and \\nprocesses of exploration and evolution to adapt a controller in response to changes in the underlay \\nnetwork. These processes generate new controllers or update (evolve) existing controllers to \\nrespond to such changes and solve the situation or task at hand more appropriately.\\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n7\\nThe process of exploratory evolution may potentially reduce the role of the human engineer by \\nexploring alternate techniques or “creative” solutions. \\nControllers may be tested using testing tools, data generators, or real data from the underlay \\nnetwork. Validation of controllers and their logic, using simulated and/or real data, may be done \\nbefore the deployment of controllers in the network. A comparison of the results of exploratory \\nevolution of controllers may result in the selection of the best variation of the solution or approach. \\nThis continuous process, based on monitoring and optimization of deployed controllers in the \\nunderlay network, is called real-time responsive experimentation.\\nFinally, the adapted and validated controllers are integrated at run-time to underlay networks. \\nDynamic adaptation is the final concept in equipping the network with autonomy and the ability to \\nhandle new and hitherto unseen changes in network scenarios. \\nWith consideration of the above concepts, an autonomous network is a network which can generate, \\nadapt, and integrate controllers at run-time using network-specific information and can realize \\nexploratory evolution, real-time responsive experimentation and dynamic adaptation. Hence, \\nnetworks which are able to handle hitherto unseen changes in network scenarios or inputs, thereby \\nreducing the human effort involved in managing the network, are termed as “autonomous \\nnetworks”. Use cases analysed in this document point to scenarios where the concepts of \\nexploratory evolution, real-time responsive experimentation and dynamic adaptation can help \\nrealizing autonomous networks.\\nThis Supplement provides various types of use cases. These use cases consist of those which \\ndirectly describe various autonomous behaviours and those which describe the applications that \\nbenefit from autonomous behaviours. For each use case, there may be various entities which are \\ninvolved in different steps of the use case. Such entities, termed here as actors, interact with each \\nother as part of the use case scenario, contributing to use case requirements. Actors may be \\nimplemented physically or virtually in the network realising the use case. Analysis of use case \\nrequirements may suggest exemplar components which could realise the use case in the network.  \\nNOTE 1 - The actors can be constituted of elements of different nature, including environment \\nstakeholders such as operators and users, modules, domains and others. \\nThis Supplement provides, where appropriate, actor-interaction diagrams and specific figures of \\nexemplar components, which may help further analysis during later stages of standardization.  \\nNOTE 2 – The components shown in the figures are exemplary in nature, pointing to a possible set \\nof components which may be used in a realization of the use case. They are hereafter referred to as \\npossible components. \\nThe analysis of use cases includes the study of the relations to the concepts of exploratory \\nevolution, real-time responsive experimentation and dynamic adaptation, as well as the derivation \\nof possible requirements and their classification according to the conventions in clause 5.  \\nNOTE 3 – From here on, for simplicity, the concepts of exploratory evolution, real-time responsive \\nexperimentation and dynamic adaptation are mentioned as, respectively, “evolution”, \\n“experimentation” and “adaptation”.  \\n7 Use cases and requirements \\nThis clause describes the use cases, their requirements and, where appropriate, actor-interaction \\ndiagrams and specific figures of possible components are provided. Use cases are classified into \\ntwo categories. Category 1 (cat 1) describes scenarios related to the autonomous behaviours \\nthemselves. Cat 1 use cases may have requirements related to the components enabling the key \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n8\\nconcepts of exploratory evolution, real-time responsive experimentation and dynamic adaptation. \\nOn the other hand, category 2 (cat 2) describes scenarios related to applications of autonomous \\nbehaviours in the network.  They may point to the ways in which possible components in the AN \\ninteract to enable benefits to the various stakeholders like operators and end users.  \\nAN-usecase-001 \\nImport and export of knowledge in an autonomous network \\n7.1\\nUse case id \\nUse case description  To  satisfy  the  key  concepts  of  autonomous  networks  (evolution,  experimentation \\nand  adaptation)  while  minimizing  human  intervention  requires  knowledge.  This \\nknowledge may include representation of data about the environment in which the \\nautonomous  system  is  operating,  possible  actions  and  consequences,  key \\nconfiguration  options,  possible  measurement  parameters  and  other  elements  of \\nlogic. This use case describes the scenarios where knowledge is accessed and used \\nby the actors involved in the AN to realize the use case. \\nGeneral use case scenarios comprise of the following steps: \\n1. Knowledge is imported from outside or peer entities of the AN components \\n2. Knowledge  is  referred  internally  in  the  AN  components,  e.g.,  for  driving \\nevolution, driving exploration, configuration of automation loops. \\n3. Generate report for human consumption \\n4. Knowledge is stored and updated within the AN components \\n5. Knowledge is exported from the AN components to outside or peer entities. \\nCat 1: describes a scenario related to core autonomous behaviour itself.   \\n[b-Clark], [b-AN2020], [b-Jimenez-Ruiz], [b-Myklebust], [b-Turing] \\nUse case category \\nReference \\n7.1.1 Use case requirements \\nCritical requirements \\nAN-UC01-REQ-001: It is critical that AN enable the exchange of knowledge between the \\n● \\ndifferent involved AN components.  \\n● \\nAN-UC01-REQ-002: It is critical that AN enable the optimization of knowledge bases. \\nNOTE 1 – Examples of optimizations applied on the knowledge bases are access policies, granularity of \\nstorage, interconnection between various knowledge bases and relation between problems and solutions, \\naddition of new knowledge. \\nAN-UC01-REQ-003: It is critical that AN enable the creation of reports on the use of \\n● \\nknowledge bases, for consumption by humans and machines. \\nNOTE 2 – Example of contents of reports are statistics on access of knowledge bases by various AN \\ncomponents as well as network services in the same or different administrative domains. \\nAN-UC01-REQ-004: It is critical that AN enable the exchange of knowledge between the \\n● \\ninvolved AN components and other entities in the same administrative domain. \\nNOTE 3 – Other entities include AN components and network services. \\nAN-UC01-REQ-005: It is critical that AN use knowledge base(s) for mapping high level use \\n● \\ncase description(s) to controller specification. \\nNOTE 4 – Controller specification may use languages such as TOSCA [b-TOSCA-Simple], whereas use \\ncase descriptions may be unstructured. The high-level use case description is to be converted to a structured \\ncontroller specification. In this process of “conversion”, it may utilize the help of humans (using GUIs) who \\ncan better understand unstructured information, and/or automated generation techniques. \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n9\\nExpected requirements \\nAN-UC01-REQ-006: It is expected that AN enable the exchange of knowledge between AN \\n● \\ncomponents and other entities in different administrative domains. \\nNOTE 5 – The entities in other administrative domains include AN components and network services. \\nAdded value requirements \\nAN-UC01-REQ-007: It is of added value that automated generation techniques are used by \\n● \\nAN to produce controller specifications, using the stored controller descriptions and the knowledge \\nbase.  \\nNOTE 6 – E.g., graph neural network (GNN)-based recommendation engine may be used to help \\nautomatic generation techniques. \\n7.1.2 Actor interactions and possible components \\nIn line with the use case description, figure 1 illustrates the interactions between various actors for \\nthe access and use of knowledge in an autonomous network. \\nFigure 1: Actor interactions for access and use of knowledge in an autonomous \\nnetwork \\nNOTE 1 – Multiple AN components (1 to n) may be present in the system. \\nNOTE 2 – Actor interactions captured in figure 1 may not reflect the strict time sequence of activities. \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n10\\nFigure 1 shows the possible interactions between various actors enabling this use case. However, \\nwhile instantiating this use case in the network, various components may be necessary. Figure 2 \\nshows a possible set of components related to the use case. The possible functions and services \\nexposed are depicted using connectors in the figure. In an implementation instance, these could be \\neither directly connected or accessed via service-based architectures. The exact nature, requirements \\nand implementations related to the components and their interactions are for future study and not in \\nthe scope of this document. \\nFigure 2: Possible components related to the access and use of knowledge in autonomous network  \\nActors involved (figure 1): \\n• Management domain: this actor includes entities in the network which configures, monitors \\nand otherwise manages the AN components in the network.  \\n• Knowledge base: this actor stores knowledge which may be queried, stored and updated by \\nvarious AN components. This may be implemented in the form of an open knowledge base. \\n• Network services within domain: these actors are network services running within the same \\nadministrative domain of the AN. Similarly, there may be network services running outside \\nthe administrative domain of the AN. \\nPossible key components involved (figure 2): \\n• AN orchestrator: this component manages the other AN components in the network.  \\n• Auto controller generator: this component may generate controllers. \\n• OpenCN: this component provides a repository of controllers. \\n• OpenKB: this component provides a repository to stores knowledge. \\n• Analytics: this component provides analytics services (including prediction, inferences) for \\nthe AN. \\n7.2 Configuring and driving simulators from autonomous components in the network \\nUse case id \\nUse case description  To explore and experiment with various autonomous behaviour scenarios, the AN \\ncomponent requires access to simulators. Simulators help evaluate the outcome of \\npossible options without potential adverse fallouts in the real network. Long term \\nstudy  of  simulation  results  is  common  by  human  researchers  to  understand  the \\nFG-AN-usecase-002 \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n11\\nevolutionary needs of the network too.  In this respect, the AN components need to \\ninterface with, configure and drive the different simulators.   \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1. The AN components decide the autonomous behaviour scenarios for exploration \\nand experimentation. \\n2. The  AN  components  interact  with  the  AN  sandbox  to  configure  specific \\nsimulators which can perform the required experimentation. \\n3. The  AN  sandbox  monitors  the  simulators  and  reports  the  completion  of \\nsimulations. \\n4. The  results  are  analysed  by  the  AN  components  and  further  actions  (like \\nupdating the knowledge base) are taken. \\nUse case category \\nReference \\nCat 1: describes a scenario related to core autonomous behaviour itself.   \\n[ITU-T Y.3172] \\n7.2.1 Use case requirements \\nCritical requirements \\nAN-UC02-REQ-001: It is critical that AN components arrive at autonomous behaviour \\n● \\nscenarios, potentially usable for exploration and experimentation.  \\nNOTE 1 – AN components may independently arrive at different autonomous behaviour scenarios usable for \\nexploration and experimentation based on several factors like the functionalities they implement, current \\nstatus of their knowledge, etc. For example, AN components may arrive at candidate strategies to be used for \\nexploration and experimentation for access control. These strategies may be based on game theory \\napproaches or combinatorial optimization approaches. \\nAN-UC02-REQ-002: It is critical that AN components trigger experimentation in the AN \\n● \\nsandbox.  \\nNOTE 2 – AN components may independently trigger experimentation by configuring simulators in the AN \\nsandbox.   \\n● \\nAN-UC02-REQ-003: It is critical that the AN sandbox collates, aggregates triggers for \\nexperimentation to form a coherent, experimentation pipeline, the execution of which is monitored \\nand reported by the AN sandbox to the AN components. \\nAN-UC02-REQ-004: It is critical that AN components analyse the reports from the AN \\n● \\nsandbox while considering the steps in AN behaviour. \\nNOTE 3 – The steps in AN behaviour which depends on the analysis of reports from the AN sandbox \\ninclude steps in evolution and update of knowledge. \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n12\\n7.2.2 Actor interactions and possible components \\nFigure 3: Actor interactions for configuring and driving simulators from autonomous components \\nin the network\\nFigure 4: Possible components related to configuring and driving simulators from autonomous \\ncomponents in the network \\nActors involved (figure 3): \\n• AN Sandbox: this actor provides an experimentation platform for controllers.

Peers \\ninclude humans and other autonomous entities. Exchange of information with peers \\nhelp  in  taking  better  decisions.  In  this  respect,  AN  components  need  to  interface \\nwith, exchange information with various other AN components and humans.   \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1. The AN components decide to take guidance from other autonomous entities \\n(peers like humans). \\n2. A message exchange with the peer is initiated. \\n3. The  results  of  the  exchange  are  analysed  by  the  AN  components  and  further \\nactions (like updating knowledge base) are taken. \\nUse case category \\nReference \\nCat 1: describes a scenario related to core autonomous behaviour itself.   \\n[Y.3172] \\n7.3.1 Use case requirements \\nCritical requirements \\nAN-UC03-REQ-001: It is critical that AN components enable synchronous or asynchronous, \\n● \\ninteroperable exchange of feedback or information from peers regarding the decisions and choices \\nrelated to the AN behaviour.  \\nNOTE 1 – Peers may include humans and machines.  \\nNOTE 2 – Feedback may include exchange of information regarding the AN behaviour such as evolution, \\nexperimentation and adaptation. Contents of the information exchanged may include capabilities and status \\nof AN components, e.g., knowledge base, orchestration and simulators.

Automation loops help implement the decisions taken by the AN \\ncomponents in the network. Moreover, it is possible that automation loops provide \\nvaluable inputs for AN components to be considered for say further experimentation.   \\nIn this respect, the AN components need to interface with, configure and drive the \\ndifferent automation loops.   \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1.

A \\nset of hierarchical AI/ML based closed loops could be used to intelligently \\ndeploy and manage slice for emergency responders in the affected area. A \\nhigher closed loop in the OSS can be used for detecting which area is affected \\nby the emergency and deploy a slice for emergency responders to that area. It \\ncan then set a resource arbitration policy for the lower closed loop in RAN. The \\nlower loop can use this policy to intelligently share RAN resources between the \\npublic and emergency responder slice. It can also intelligently manage ML \\npipelines across the edge and emergency responder devices by using split \\nAI/ML models or offloading of inference tasks from the devices to the edge. \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n22\\nNOTE 1 - An instance of open RAN architecture is explained in [b-O-\\nRAN.WG1.O-RAN-Arch], including near-RT RICs and non-RT RICs which \\nhost applications designed to run with different latency requirements (e.g. \\nxApps and rApps). The applications may be implemented independent of the \\nRIC implementations and may be provided by any third party.  \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1. The mobile network operator (MNO) may instruct the OSS to detect \\ncertain set of emergencies and provide connectivity to emergency \\nresponders according to predefined SLA. \\nNOTE 2 - For example, this input may be provided using an operator \\nintent. \\n2. The OSS might deploy a closed loop to achieve this. It might collect \\ndata from sources like network analytics data, social media scraping, \\ninput from emergency responders etc.  \\nNOTE 3 - For example, such inputs may be provided from nRT-RICs \\nor other NFs in the network. \\n3. The OSS might use AI/ML models to detect emergency and deploy an \\nemergency response (ER) slice to the location. It might also create high \\nlevel strategy/policy to reallocate resources among the slices. \\nNOTE 4 - Such closed loops may be hosted in non-RT RIC and may be \\nused for predictive resource allocations to specific edge locations based \\non predicted needs, in turn based on detected emergency. \\nNOTE 5 - The policy to reallocate resources may depend, among other \\nthings, on the type of emergency e.g. a natural disaster, earthquake, a \\nlaw and order situation, traffic accidents, etc. \\n4. The RAN domain might use this high-level strategy/policy and \\npossibly other inputs from emergency responders to create a closed \\nloop to arbitrate resources among RAN network slice sub-net \\ninstances (NSSI). \\nNOTE 6 - Such closed loops may be hosted nearer to edge, e.g. nRT \\nRIC. The policy input from higher loop may indicate, among other \\nthings, the different sources of data for the lower loop. \\n5. The RAN domain closed loop might also decide to offload inference \\ntasks from ER devices to the edge or use split AI/ML model to run \\ninference tasks on edge and ER device. This decision might be taken \\nbased on available network and compute resources. \\nNOTE 7 - Some layers of the AI/ML model may be hosted in the \\nwearable devices of the emergency responders, which will help in say \\nlocating of persons under distress using various inputs. \\nRelation with autonomous behaviour-  \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n23\\n1. Workflows for the closed loops are independent of each other. The \\nonly interaction between closed loops is via high level intents over the \\ninter-loop interface.  \\n2. Closed loops can create new closed loops in other network domains \\nwithout human intervention. \\n3. Although loops are deployed in hierarchical fashion, each loop has the \\nability to evolve independently. It can use different models and ML \\npipelines as required. Each loop may move up or down the autonomy \\nlevels as defined in [ITU-T Y.3173]. \\n4. Closed loops have ability to split and provision AI/ML models to other \\nclosed loops in automated fashion.   \\n5. By making closed loops in edge domain autonomous, the use case also \\nenables lesser orchestration delay, better privacy and flexibility for \\nverticals (e.g., industrial campus networks). \\n6. Higher loops can use historical knowledge available to them to \\noptimize and generalize lower loops using high-level intent.

The components (“nodes”) of the high-\\nlevel service are decomposed into more concrete services (possibly recursively). Declarative policies must be \\n“translated” into more concrete declarative policies on the decomposed services in conjunction. For example, \\n“non-RT” level service may impose certain closed loop requirements on a RIC that implements the ML \\npipeline. “nRT” level service may impose some other closed loop requirements on a RIC that implements \\nthat ML pipeline. This recursive decomposition coupled with recursive policy mapping happens all the way \\ndown until service components can get realized on the available resources. At that point, the low-level \\ndeclarative policies must be translated somehow into imperative policies (e.g., if jitter exceeds a certain \\nthreshold, re-prioritize the traffic associated with the service). \\nNOTE 2 – “Imperative” policies that use the “event/condition/action” pattern, vs. declarative policies use a \\n“capabilities/context/constraints” pattern. Declarative policies are more suitable for top-level “intent” \\nstatements, but they need to be translated (by the orchestrator) into corresponding “imperative” policies in \\norder to be actionable. The \"propagation\" and \"escalation\" of intents: the “event/condition/action” statements \\nare the control loops you’re referring to that make sure that service components comply with desired \\nbehaviour at all times. By coupling “event/condition/action” control loops with TOSCA’s substitution \\nmapping feature, you can make these control loops “cascading”, i.e. they can propagate down from high-\\nlevel abstract “intent” statements to low-level device reconfigurations, and they can escalate back up if \\nnecessary.  \\nNOTE 3 – The events are generated (using notifications) by nodes in the service topology model. The \\nconditions are evaluated based on attribute values of nodes in the service topology model. The actions are \\nperformed on the service topology model first, and then propagated to the external world (the “resources”) \\n7.10 Inter-domain service automation (IDSA) - for microfinance \\nUse case id \\nFG-AN-usecase-010 \\nUse case description  Microfinance applications may be hosted by non-experts in IMT-2020 or any form \\nof cloud / ICT technologies.

Frequently bank branches \\nhave to fall back on costly and complex connectivity through satellites. Other than \\nthe  capital  and  operational  aspects,  the  bank  staff  also  needs  to  handle  the  link \\nfailover and maintenance activities in case of issues. Furthermore, such solutions do \\nnot allow local community to utilize the network.  \\nAutonomous last hop connectivity both through IMT-Advanced/IMT-2020 as well \\nas other non 3GPP heterogeneous networks need to be seamlessly enabled to operate \\nin an affordable manner. The solution is likely to provide the following benefits: \\n1.  Based  on  the  requirements  from  the  verticals,  provide  connectivity  for  rural \\nfinance (FI)sites independent of network providers or large-Telcos. \\n2. Allow the connectivity to be shared with local community to ensure better return \\non investments. \\n3. Edge compute and related infrastructure can enable more compelling deployments \\nfor digital FI as well as other verticals (e.g. short-term tele-commute / interviews \\netc.). \\n4.  Automate  operations  and  security  audits:  reducing  human  involvement  in \\nmaintaining  and  running  the  edge  or  last  hop  reduces  training  costs  for  banks, \\noperational costs in networks and brings other benefits like intelligent fault isolation \\nwithout  depending  on  3rd  party  service  providers,  continuous  audit  of  deployed \\nsolution for security etc. \\nFollowing are related sub-systems and associated steps in this use case scenario: \\n1.

Levels  of  autonomy  for  unmanned  systems  are \\nintroduced, especially ranging from “sub-functions” to single functions to single \\nsystem to teams. A framework for robot autonomy is discussed with corresponding \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n46\\nguidelines.  Based  on  these,  the  characteristics  for  operations  in  hostile \\nenvironments are listed.  \\n[b-FGAN-O-013-R1]  calls  out  the  requirements  for  operations  with  autonomous \\nsystems.  Relation  between  the  needed  level  of  autonomy  depending  on \\nenvironment and type of task in contrast to capabilities of the system in combination \\nwith  policies.  Systems  should  provide  the  best  possible  support  and  hence  the \\nautonomy level has to be adjusted such that humans only have to intervene when it \\nis  necessary  and  makes  sense.  Due  to  dynamics  during  missions  in  hostile \\nenvironments,  the  systems  have  to  adapt  their  autonomy  level  at  run-time  (or \\nhumans  have  to  do  it)  according  to  the  situation  and  the  corresponding \\nrequirements. The existing stage levels of autonomy have to be extended by the \\nability of switching the level in run-time (judgement by design vs. judgement in \\nrun time) \\nA  simple  workflow  scheme  for  autonomy  with  varying  autonomy  levels  is \\ndiscussed.  This  includes  task  specification  by  human  and  task  understanding, \\nfeasibility check, task planning, task execution by system. Request for support to \\nhuman and control by human can be to any of these workflow steps. Monitoring of \\nperformance levels by humans and learning by the system are added steps.   \\nAutonomy  level  and  dependency  on  competence  are  discussed.  Competence \\nanalysis as a weighted function of capabilities needed, capabilities existing, existing \\noptions for actions and existing constraints is described. \\nFollowing are the additional considerations in this use case: \\n1. Taking telco service design, development, deployment and operations (ops) as \\nan example - the levels of autonomy may be applied in as follows:  \\n(a)  Service  design  is  done  by  designers  (100%  designer  interaction,  no  ops \\ninteraction)  \\n(b)  Existing  software  development  kits  (SDKs)  and  application  programming \\ninterfaces (APIs) are exercised to create applications (e.g. rApps or xApps) – (high \\nlevel designer interaction, high code but low ops interaction) \\n(c)  Configuration  of  existing  or  new  services  in  real  time  environments  (e.g. \\ndistributed unit (DU) – mid level designer interaction, high ops involvement).  \\n(d) Service deployment and QoE measurement in customer premises (e.g. VoD – \\nno code, low designer interaction, collaborative, high ops involvement).  \\nThus, it may be relevant to consider the nature of the task in addition to the type of \\nenvironment, e.g. for the ops engineers the design phase is a “difficult environment” \\n(due to low involvement) and for the service designers the customer premises is a \\n“difficult environment” (due to constraints in site visits).  \\nThus, it may be relevant to consider a multi-agent system where the agents have \\nvaried competences (capabilities, options for actions and constraints).   \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1.

Low \\nlatency, low power consumption and small footprint are considerations for AI \\napplications at  the  edge. Accelerated,  AI-enabled  applications  at  the  edge  are \\nimportant enablers for future networks.  \\n2) As AI technology evolves, AI models evolve, the acceleration platform must \\nalso be adaptable and at the same time satisfying the requirements above.

The contribution proposed to build Digital \\nTwins of Computer Network infrastructures. Some examples of the \\n(hypothetical) questions which could be answered using digital twins were \\nlisted as: Which is the best network upgrade given a budget? Which is the best \\nlink upgrade to accommodate a new customer? What is the method to support a \\nnew customer SLA with the current network capacity? etc. \\nThe impact of digital twins in Network Planning and Upgrading, \\nTroubleshooting and Performance Analysis, What-if Analysis were described \\nin [b-FGAN-O-013-R1]. This makes digital twins a perfect environment for \\nexperimentation in the context of autonomous networks. \\n[b-FGAN-O-013-R1] took the approach of using neural networks (NN) to build \\ndigital twins. The approach using graph neural network (GNN) [b-Scarselli] \\nwas described. It generalizes to unseen topologies, routings and traffics. \\nSpecific example of RouteNet [b-Rusek-2] was described. RouteNet can \\ngeneralize to unseen topologies, routings and traffic matrices.  \\nDRL+GNN looks as a promising technique for real-time network optimization \\nwas introduced in [b-FGAN-O-013-R1]. \\nAN aims to remove the human from the control loop. This poses hard \\nchallenges to offer 100% guarantees once the AN products are deployed in \\nnetworks. In order to achieve mature solutions for autonomous network control, \\nit will be essential for AN vendors to validate in advance that their products \\nwill operate successfully in the target customer networks, before they are \\nactually deployed.  \\nA DT can be used to estimate accurately the resulting network performance of \\nan experimentation approach and the effect after applying the actions produced \\nby the AN, thus determining what network scenarios are well-supported by the \\nproduct.  After  a  comprehensive  validation  test,  the  vendor  can  apply  the \\nadaptations to the network.\\nFollowing are examples of scenarios in this use case: \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n54\\nScenario-1: preparation of DT: import network configurations (including \\nclosed loops) into digital twin. This sets the stage for preparation of simulations \\nin the DT. \\nScenario-2: trigger of DT for simulations: update of network configurations \\nin digital twin (if any, by engineer), followed by simulations in digital twin and \\ngeneration of asynchronous events. These events are consumed by AN engine \\nand may in turn result in experimental configurations/updates from the AN \\nengine towards the DT. This cycle may continue based on the sequence of \\nsimulations and scenarios in the DT. The validation of KPIs in the DT as a \\nresult of experimentation and adaptations by the AN engine is an important \\nstep. \\nScenario-3: trigger of AN engine by operator: update of network \\npolicy/configurations by engineer, which triggers AN engine to corresponding \\nexperiments or configurations towards the digital twin. Experimentation may \\nbe configured in the digital twin and corresponding events and KPIs may be \\nused to evaluation the result of the experimentation. This may result in \\nselecting the best possible sequence of actions or adaptations towards the \\nnetwork. The validation of the AN engine actions is an important step here. \\nScenario-4: trigger based on evolution: Other triggers for experiments in AN \\nengine may include inputs from evolution functionality. Experimentation and \\nevaluation of actions or adaptations towards the network are same as above. \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1. Import environment into DT, trigger simulations in DT and validate the \\nresults, especially the use case specific closed loops. \\n2.

The advantages of this approach include the capability to \\naddress wide-range of scenarios, where a mathematical model is difficult to \\nmake (e.g. channel estimation, beam management for future networks).  \\nExisting solutions mostly rely on explicit coordination between the transmitter \\n(TX) and the receiver (RX), introducing problems of interoperability and \\nnecessity for standards. Such signalling messages eat into the costly spectrum \\nand complicate protocol design.  \\nA data-driven approach based on neural networks (NN) is an alternative to \\nachieve coordination-free interoperability.  \\nAn example scenario for the use case is as follows: \\nMillimeter wave (mmWave) communication with large antenna arrays is a \\npromising technique to enable extremely high data rates. Because of their \\nhighly directional transmissions, radios operating at millimeter wave \\n(mmWave) frequencies need to perform beam management to establish and \\nmaintain reliable mmWave links. Transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) need \\nto coordinate to select the beam pair that yields the highest beamforming gain.  \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n56\\nCurrently 5G NR defines the stages of exhaustive beam sweep (EBS) as: initial \\naccess (IA) and beam tracking. For both IA and beam tracking, the 3rd\\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) NR standard for 5G communications \\nutilizes synchronization signal blocks (SSBs) [b-3GPP 36.331].  \\nBeam management for the IA procedure in 3GPP NR involves: \\n1) Beam sweep: Base station transmits directional Synchronization Signals \\n(SSs) to cover all the TXBs of a certain codebook. Each beam is swept with an \\nSSB, which is a group of 4 OFDM symbols and 240 subcarriers in frequency. \\n2) Beam measurement: The User Equipment (UE) itself, if configured for \\ndirectional reception, performs a directional scan, measuring the quality of each \\nbeam pair \\n3) Beam decision: The UE selects the beam to be used to perform initial access \\n4) Beam reporting: During the next SSB in the selected direction, the UE \\nacquires information on the time and frequency resources in which the base \\nstation will be in receive mode for the random access message using the same \\nTXB. \\nReceiver can associate Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) levels to beams without \\nexplicit coordination with the transmitter using pilot-less estimation technique. \\nThe RX infers the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and the TXB by passively \\neavesdropping on data transmissions to other users in the network. This is \\nenabled by leveraging a data-driven approach based on convolutional neural \\nnetworks (CNNs) to achieve coordination-free beam management in mmWave \\nnetworks based on a unique “signature” of the beam from the impairments. \\nThis method infers the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the beam and the actual beam \\nbeing used by the transmitter through waveform-level deep learning on ongoing \\ntransmissions between the TX to other receivers. Experimentation is achieved \\nby experimental data collection campaign with two software-defined radio \\ntestbeds, and by using multiple antennas, codebooks, gains and locations and \\nincludes 3 different AoAs and multiple TX and RX locations.\\nEvaluation criteria includes an upper bound on the expected search time of the \\nproposed algorithm. The proposed technique reduces latency by up to 7x with \\nrespect to the 5G NR initial beam sweep in a default configuration and with a \\n12-beam codebook. \\nFollowing are related steps in this use case scenario: \\n1. Based on the analysis of data from the network, reference points are selected \\nby evolution where data-driven NN based approaches can be applied to reduce \\nsignalling. Evolution should cherry-pick the reference points which has the best \\ntrade-offs in terms of benefits (e.g. spectral efficiency, latency, etc) as against \\nthe cost of training. Evolution should also help in understanding the \\nexperimentation approaches to follow. \\n2.

Another  option  is \\ndeploying small base stations known as small cells and each small cell try to serve \\nset of users.  \\nMicrocell, metro cell, Pico cell and femtocells are collectively known as small cells \\nand  network  containing  all  these  base  stations  are  termed  as  \"heterogeneous \\nnetworks”. To optimize the use of bandwidth, co-channel deployment mechanisms \\nare assumed, i.e. macro cell and small cells will share the same set of sub-channels. \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n64\\nTransmission among small cells may cause interference not only among them but \\nalso  to  the  macro  cell  users.  Hence,  efficient  resource  allocation  algorithms  are \\nconsiderd to mitigate interference among them so as to satisfy QoS constraints of all \\nthe devices/users.  \\nDistributed algorithms may be needed to mitigate the interference since there may \\nnot be coordination (e.g. X2 interface [b-3GPP 36.420]) among the small cells.  \\nIn  this  scenario,  distributed  resource  allocation  (subchannel  allocation  and power \\nallocation to each subchannel) are proposed so as to satisfy QoS requirements of all \\nthe devices. NOTE- Game theory based model is proposed and to reach equilibrium \\npoints both traditional based algorithms like ML algorithms are proposed. \\nStory-1 for the use case: In an enterprise deployment of small cell, say in a factory \\nfloor,  low  latency  is  required  for  certain  UEs,  e.g.  robotic  arms  or  self-guided \\nvehicles such as in Industry 4.0 use cases. Macro cell coverage is limited in such \\nindoor  factory  floors  and  interference  is  a  problem.  Resource  allocation  for  low-\\nlatency  UEs  in  the  presence  of  interference  and  low  coverage  by  macro  is  the \\nproblem addressed in this “story”.  \\n● Co-existence  of  UEs  that  require  low  latency  service  and  that  does  not \\nrequire low latency service \\no Each  small  cell  can  allocate  certain  channels  (power  has  to  be \\nallocated  via  game  theory)  to  UEs  that  require  low  latency  (high \\npriority basis) and for other UEs it can allocate channel and power \\nby playing game model \\no Power allocation is based on UEs rate requirement \\n● Serving UEs that all require low latency \\no The small cell that serves these users can act as a leader and other \\ncells can act as a follower. \\no Here priority will go to the leader and after allocation of resource \\nby this cell, all others will allocate resources accordingly by playing \\nStackelberg game model [b-Sankar-2]. \\n● Given  the  measurements  such  as  channel  gains  observed  by  user  on  a \\nparticular subchannel along with interference plus noise on that channel, it \\nis needed to allocate channel and power per subchannel so as to satisfy user \\nrequirements (e.g., rate, low latency) \\no Here channel allocation matrix and power per subchannel (known \\nas  Nash  Equilibrium-NE  point  [b-Sankar-1])  has  to  be  computed \\niteratively  via  game  theory  approach.  Three  different  kind  of \\nalgorithms such as traditional optimised algorithm, reinforcement \\nlearning algorithm and genetic algorithm, are used. \\no Comparison of the above algorithms for better usage.  \\no Once it is created the data set that consists of various measurements-\\nchannel gains, interference plus noise, set of sub channels, user per \\ncell,  user  requirements  along  with  NE  point,    the  supervised \\nlearning (SL) model can be trained (this model sits at the small BSs \\nto obtain subchannel allocation and power per subchannel depends \\non  the  local  measurements  along  with  other  inputs  at  each  small \\nBS). \\no Compare the output from SL with traditional methods. \\n● Supposing  there  are  multiple  users  try  to  access  the  channel  at  a \\nparticular time and resources are scarce, then it s needed to schedule the \\nusers  into  different  frame  durations  (msec).  For  this  auctioning \\nmechanism is considered to schedule the user in a particular time slot. \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n65\\nUtility for each auction is a function of user requirements such as rate, \\nlatency etc. \\n● Once  the  user  scheduling  is  performed,  then  channel  and  power  per \\n●\\nchannel according to algorithm described above, are performed. \\nIn  the  above  procedure  both  time  domain  and  frequency  domain \\nscheduling are performed separately.  \\nStory-2:  surveillance  videos–  high  UL  rate  is  required  for  cameras  –  macro  cell \\ncoverage  and  interference  is  problem.  Allocation  for  rate-required  UEs  in  the \\npresence  of  interference  and  low  coverage  by  macro.  Priority  allocation  for  UL \\nintensive UEs to achieve QoS. \\nStory-3: power constrained – wearables etc – privacy – user specific data cannot be \\nexposed to 3rd party – to do analytics, no data should be taken out of the trust zone \\n(enterprise or private network). All AI/ML, analytics etc needs to be done within the \\nprivate network.  \\nThe steps in the use case (related to autonomy) are: \\n1. Controllers are formed based on, e.g., Intents and/or Evolution (Ev) to optimize \\nresource allocation with various considerations including latency, throughput or \\nprivacy preserving analytics. \\n2. Modelling of inter-controller interaction using game theory: “Players” in the \\ngame would be the equivalence classes of controllers. “players” may be selected \\nfrom the evolvable population.\\n3. (Initial) Strategies/gains/payoffs are defined and initialized for each equivalence \\nclass and game is modelled. \\n4. Players [controllers] can be cooperating or non-cooperating. They may \\nparticipate in the game based on trust. \\n5. Modelling of strategies/gains/payoff for each player (controller) may change \\nbased on Evolution. \\n6. Use experimentation (Ex) to study the model (strategies/gains) which is evolved \\nand the elements of trust in this game can be studied. And the strategies for \\nmaximizing the gains can also be investigated, either by cooperation or non-\\ncooperation. \\n7. Adaptations to be applied to the Controllers are arrived at – in the form of \\nchanges to strategies, gains/payoffs and trust. Formation of new “players” may be \\npart of adaptation. \\n8.

In-Network Programs such as Forward Error \\nCorrection (FEC), traffic compression, encapsulation/decapsulation, etc are typical \\napplications in dataplanes.

The operators or interested parties like Mobile Virtual Network \\nOperators (MVNOs) share the network for various reasons like reduce CAPEX \\nand OPEX (reduce TCO in general), providing coverage for the users.  \\nThere are some underlying arrangements for sharing the network like RAN \\nsharing, spectrum sharing, core network and transport network sharing. These \\narrangements are governed by the agreement between the interested parties. The \\narrangements possibly could be network slicing, 3GPP based network sharing or \\nsome custom vendor solution. The arrangements are rigid and not flexible because \\nof a prior agreement between the parties. The prior agreement creates a boundary \\nbetween the operators, and any change in the boundary requires a revisit to the \\nagreement.  \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n78\\nNOTE – Forming new agreements with different operators, withdrawing the \\nexisting agreement, and changing service level agreements (SLA) are examples of \\nchanges in boundaries between operators. \\nFrom the AN perspective, the strict boundary is a roadblock towards autonomy. \\nThe boundaries is required be flexible, scale in and out dynamically without \\ninvolving any central authority (here operator/human). The AN decides the scaling \\nof boundaries(in/out) based on the requirement. The control loops, intent or some \\nprediction algorithm can generate requirements for the action of AN. The AN is \\nrequired to adapt and provide the associated management like policing, billing and \\nother configured elements related to the shared arrangement between the interested \\nparties. The AN is required to have the capability to negotiate the boundaries \\nthrough the adapted agreements between the interested parties. The negotiation of \\nboundaries means the AN can independently change the agreements in runtime. \\nThe following describes an example of load balancing: \\n1. Consider a scenario of base stations deployed by different operators in a \\nsingle coverage area.  \\n2. The base station is loaded, and there is a need to balance the load for \\nserving the users with the desired quality of service. \\n3. In the case of non-AN, the base station can balance the load to different \\noperators base stations. However, it can only scale out to the pre-defined \\noperators in the agreement, and those base stations can also be loaded. To \\nscale out to the other base stations, it needs an operator(human) in the loop \\nwho then complete the sharing agreement and provision arrangements. \\n4. In AN case, the base station can identify the requirement to load balance \\nthe users to other base stations. The AN acts independently to adapt the \\nagreement and scale its coverage via other base stations with reduced \\nintervention of operator(human).

The \\noperator drives the choice of equipment, procurement, testing and deployment. \\nPlanning tools can help to automate the deployment process.  \\nModern advancements include deploying drones for inspection and monitoring of \\ndeployed base stations [b-Sharma]. Such inspection by drones is a step towards \\nautomation and autonomy. Mission critical applications require the on-demand \\ndeployment of the network, with rapid deployment. The supply chain\\'s end-to-end \\norchestration stage helps in deployment of network equipment, virtual or physical, \\nwhich brings the network equipment to up and running stage. In an ultra-dense \\ndeployment world, the scale of equipment in numbers is very large and hence \\ncreates challenges for an operator to manage millions of equipment deployed in \\ndifferent geographies. This brings to the fore, the importance of autonomous \\nnetworks supported by an end-to-end orchestrated supply chain. \\nIn this use case, end-to-end orchestration of the supply chain is studied in the AN \\ncontext. There is a need to delegate the control from the operator to AN and \\nremove the dependency of the operator. The AN can act independently and decide \\nthe orchestration of the supply chain as per the requirements. All physical \\noperations such as power-up of equipment, cabling, but it can certainly schedule \\nthose events, notify required teams, and monitor progress. Furthermore, the AN \\nY series – Supplement 71 (07/2022) - prepublished version \\n81\\nexposes interfaces for operators or orchestrators to feed the vendor lists, equipment \\nlists for bootstrapping and update process. The AN drives the end-to-end supply \\nchain orchestration with minimal intervention of the operator in run time. \\nThe following describes an example: \\n1. The operator feeds the list of vendors or procurement of equipment in AN. \\nIt is similar to the source of the image in the docker file. Over a period of \\ntime, the AN could learn which equipment from which vendor and rate the \\nvendors based on the performance of their equipment. \\n2. AN identifies the need to provision network equipment for various reasons \\nlike replacement for fault equipment, expansion of the network\\'s capacity, \\nnew sites, upgrade, emergency deployment. \\n3. AN understands the need possibly through some optimization algorithm, \\ndirect requirement through intents, other orchestration mechanisms, \\nprediction-based control loops. \\n4. AN drives the supply chain by procuring, testing the equipment and finally \\ndeploying the equipment. The testing requires operator intervention for \\nphysical activities. The AN runs the automated test procedures and tallies \\nthe results to decide the deployment of equipment. \\n5. AN configures the underlying equipment and newly deployed equipment \\nfor integration to go live. \\nUse case category \\nCat 2: Describes a scenario related to application of autonomous behaviour in the \\nnetwork.   \\nReference \\n[b-Sharma] \\n7.38.1 Use case requirements \\nCritical requirements \\nAN-UC038-REQ-001: It is critical that autonomous networks support interface towards and \\n● \\norchestration of software and hardware inventory management systems in underlay networks. \\nAN-UC038-REQ-002: It is critical that autonomous networks support interface towards \\n● \\nrespective teams (human or bot) or operations centre of the software and hardware \\ncomponents/equipment/systems.  \\nNOTE –Examples of orchestration of inventory management systems are representing and triggering \\naddition, deletion and changes in the inventory.

There could be various control loops deployed at various endpoints in a \\nheterogeneous AN. The various endpoints could be the edge, cloud, devices like \\nswitches, routers, user terminals, customer premises equipment, in general, a \\ncontrol loop possibly in every network equipment.  \\nDifferent vendors develop various control loops for delivering specific \\nfunctionality of the AN, focusing on improving cost, efficiency, performance, \\nscalability factors. Single vendor solutions which develop the entire AN are rare. \\nMost of the solutions would incorporate a plug and play design. In such a scenario, \\nthere is a need for AN to adopt an open design for inclusiveness.  \\nInclusive design helps the AN to plug any control loop from any vendor based on \\nits requirement. AN act independently without involving any central authority to \\ninclude the third-party control loops. To enable such inclusive design, the AN is \\nrequired to expose an interface to integrate control loops. The interface requires \\nmeta-data about control loops. AN independently manages the lifecycle of the \\ncontrol loops. AN requires the capability to test and configure the control loops. \\nThe vendors would use such an interface to develop the application (control loop), \\nknowing that it will help integrate their application. Such a design helps the \\necosystem to provide innovative solutions.  \\nThis use case realization includes a control loop application store, where vendors \\ncan publish their control loops, and any AN can use it as a repository for control \\nloops. A vendor does not need to publish the control loop in the application store. \\nAN can fetch the control loop from the required location defined in the system.  \\nThe following describes an example: \\n1. AN identifies the need to deploy a control loop for a particular service or \\nupdate the existing control (maybe evolutionary) \\n2. Based on the requirement, AN search the control loop either in the \\napplication store or at a pre-configured location \\n3. AN download the control loop, test it in a sandbox environment and \\nconfigures it. The configuration provides control loops providing access to \\nresources. The resources could be data, storage, network, placement, \\nsecurity \\n4. Once configured, AN deploys the control loop and continuously monitors \\nthe performance of the control loop \\n5.

Multiple control loops from different vendors and operators surround \\nAN at any given location or endpoint in such a HetNet scenario. AN need to be \\naware of the surrounding control loops or other AN in general. It could be for \\nvarious reasons like collaboration, coordination, security, training machine \\nlearning model, split learning, offload. AN must have an interface to communicate \\nand interact with other control loops in different AN and control loops within the \\nAN. The interface is required to enable other control loops to be autonomous, \\ndiscover each other, communicate directly with other control loops without \\ninvolving any centralized entity. The control loops within the AN may have a \\ncentralized entity, but communication with the external control loop is without a \\ncentralized entity. The AN is self-sufficient to act independently.  \\nConsider the following example of usage of interface: \\n1. The discovery of nearby control loops and AN is available at edge nodes \\n2. An edge node AN_1 entity running some application and because of heavy \\nburst load in the requests, it runs short of compute and storage to maintain \\nthe desired quality of service \\n3. The AN_1 node identifies the problem based on the feedback, monitoring, \\nany logic/algorithm. It seeks out help in the form of collaboration to \\noffload the requests using the interface \\n4. Another AN edge node AN_2 responds with its capability and SLA \\nparameters. The AN_1 evaluates and decide to offload the requests to \\nAN_2. \\n5. AN_1 and AN_2 uses the interface to configure the routing and policy to \\ndivert the traffic to AN_2 and initiate the offload process. \\n6.
